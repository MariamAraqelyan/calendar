📅 Modern Angular Calendar
Reactive. Precise. Scalable.
A professional-grade calendar component suite for Angular 21. Designed with a focus on Signals-based reactivity, BEM CSS architecture, and accessible rem-based scaling.

🚀 Core Architectural Pillars
⚡ Signals-First Reactivity
Built without Zone.js dependency in mind, utilizing the latest Angular Signal APIs (computed, effect, and input/output) for granular DOM updates and high-performance event rendering.

🎨 BEM + REM Styling
BEM Methodology: Strict naming convention ensures no style leakage and easy overrides.

Fluid Scaling: Every dimension (from margins to grid heights) is defined in rem, ensuring the calendar scales perfectly with browser font-size settings for accessibility.

Prefix-free: No more hss- clutter. Clean, semantic classes like .calendar-container__event.

🛠 Constant-Driven Logic
Time calculations, grid heights, and day offsets are managed via a centralized configuration, eliminating "magic numbers" and making the calendar highly adaptable to different locales or business hours.
